        <h2>The trick to deliver a deadly Smash</h2>
        <p>Many of us would have caught badminton replays of Olympians on TV, jumping in slow motion with 
            their racket arm recoiled. In a split second, the shuttlecock pierces through the air downwards 
            to the opponent’s ground to the vehement cheers of the crowd, signifying a point scored. <br>
            That shot there, is called a smash and when executed with power and speed it is one of the most difficult
             plays to return. Unlike a net kill, a badminton smash requires a great deal of power and is 
             a move which can easily kill of the rally and win you points. <br>            
            Like most badminton shots, a smash can be performed with both the forehand and backhand. Which is why 
            mastering both grips is of utmost importance!

         <h3> <u>How to perform a forehand badminton smash: </u></h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Adopt a forehand grip.</li>
                <li>Shift your weight to the back foot, bend your elbow, lock your wrist and prepare to swing forward.</li>
                <li>Make contact with your shuttle at the highest point possible and swing your arm forward with force, 
                    straightening your elbow as you hit the shuttle.</li>
                <li>Jerk your wrist downwards when the racquet is in contact with the shuttle, to give the shuttle more 
                    power to angle it downwards towards your opponent’s court.</li>
                <li>Do a follow through with your racquet.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3><u>To perform a backhand smash: </u></h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Adopt a backhand grip.</li>
                <li>Have your back face the net.</li>
                <li>Shift your weight to your racket foot, and lift your arm with your forearm being parallel to the floor.</li>
                <li>Keep the racket arm close to your body and hold the racket pointing down.</li>
                <li>As with the forehand smash, hit the shuttle at the highest point of contact and flick down your wrist to 
                    generate more power.</li>
                <li>With a backhand smash, a follow through is not needed</li>
                <li>Apart from these two popular smashes, there is the “Around the Head Smash”. This is played at the 
                    non-racquet side of your body and it is very similar to the forehand overhead smash except for a few minor adjustments.</li>
